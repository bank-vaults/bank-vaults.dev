Bank-Vaults provides the following tools for Hashicorp Vault to make its use easier and more automated:

- A [Kubernetes operator for provisioning secrets]({{< relref "/docs/operator/_index.md" >}}).
- A [mutating webhook for injecting secrets]({{< relref "/docs/mutating-webhook/_index.md" >}}).
- A [CLI tool]({{< relref "/docs/cli-tool/_index.md" >}}) to automatically initialize, unseal, and configure Vault with authentication methods and secret engines.
- A [Go client wrapper]({{< relref "/docs/go-library/_index.md" >}}) for the official Vault client with automatic token renewal, built-in Kubernetes support, and a dynamic database credential provider.
