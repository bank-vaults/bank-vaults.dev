title: HSM Support
weight: 690
---

Bank-Vaults offers a lot of alternatives for encrypting and storing the `unseal-keys` and the `root-token` for Vault. One of the encryption technics is the HSM - Hardware Security Module. HSM offers an industry-standard way to encrypt your data in on-premise environments.

You can use a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to generate and store the private keys used by Bank-Vaults. Some articles still point out the speed of HSM devices as their main selling point, but an average PC can do more cryptographic operations. Rather the main benefit is from the security point of view. An HSM protects your private keys and handles cryptographic operations, which allows the encryption of protected information without exposing the private keys (they are not extractable). Bank-Vaults currently supports the [PKCS11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_11) software standard to communicate with an HSM. Fulfilling compliance requirements (for example, PCI DSS) is also a great benefit of HSMs, so from now on you can achieve that with Bank-Vaults.

## Implementation in Bank-Vaults

To support HSM devices for encrypting unseal-keys and root-tokens, Bank-Vaults:

- implements an encryption/decryption `Service` named `hsm` in the `bank-vaults` CLI,
- the `bank-vaults` Docker image now includes the SoftHSM (for testing) and the OpenSC tooling,
- the operator is aware of HSM and its nature.

The HSM offers an encryption mechanism, but the unseal-keys and root-token have to be stored somewhere after they got encrypted. Currently there are two possible solutions for that:

- Some HSM devices can store a limited quantity of arbitrary data (like Nitrokey HSM), and Bank-Vaults can store the unseal-keys and root-token here.
- If the HSM does not support that, Bank-Vaults uses the HSM to encrypt the unseal-keys and root-token, then stores them in [Kubernetes Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/). We believe that it is safe to store these keys in Kubernetes Secrets in encrypted format.
- In future versions, we will probably offer more storage backends, [contact us if you have a specific use case](/contact/).

Bank-Vaults offers the ability to use the pre-created the cryptographic encryption keys on the HSM device, or generate a key pair on the fly if there isn't any with the specified label in the specified slot.

Since Bank-Vaults is written in Go, it uses the [github.com/miekg/pkcs11](https://github.com/miekg/pkcs11) wrapper to pull in the PKCS11 library, to be more precise the `p11` high-level wrapper .

## SoftHSM support for testing

You can use [SoftHSMv2](https://github.com/opendnssec/SoftHSMv2) to implement and test software interacting with PKCS11 implementations. You can install it on macOS by running the following commands:

```bash
# Initializing SoftHSM to be able to create a working example (only for dev),
# sharing the HSM device is emulated with a pre-created keypair in the image.
brew install softhsm
softhsm2-util --init-token --free --label bank-vaults --so-pin banzai --pin banzai
pkcs11-tool --module /usr/local/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so --keypairgen --key-type rsa:2048 --pin banzai --token-label bank-vaults --label bank-vaults
```

To interact with SoftHSM when using the `vault-operator`, include the following `unsealConfig` snippet in the Vault CR:

```yaml
  # This example relies on the SoftHSM device initialized in the Docker image.
  unsealConfig:
    hsm:
      # The HSM SO module path (softhsm is built into the bank-vaults image)
      modulePath: /usr/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so 
      tokenLabel: bank-vaults
      pin: banzai
      keyLabel: bank-vaults
```

To run the whole SoftHSM based example in Kubernetes, run the following commands:

```bash
kubectl create namespace vault-infra
helm upgrade --install vault-operator banzaicloud-stable/vault-operator --namespace vault-infra
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/banzaicloud/bank-vaults/master/operator/deploy/cr-hsm-softhsm.yaml
```

## NitroKey HSM support (OpenSC)

[Nitrokey HSM](https://www.nitrokey.com/) is a USB HSM device based on the [OpenSC project](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC). We are using NitroKey to develop real hardware-based HSM support for Bank-Vaults. This device is not a cryptographic accelerator. Only key generation and the private key operations (sign and decrypt) are supported. Public key operations should be done by extracting the public key and working on the computer, and this is how it is implemented in Bank-Vaults. It is not possible to extract private keys from NitroKey HSM, the device is tamper-resistant.

This device supports only RSA based encryption/decryption, and thus this is implemented in Bank-Vaults currently. It supports ECC keys as well, but only for sign/verification operations.

Install OpenSC and initialize the NitroKey HSM stick:

```bash
brew install opensc
sc-hsm-tool --initialize --label bank-vaults --pin banzai --so-pin banzaicloud
pkcs11-tool --module /usr/local/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so --keypairgen --key-type rsa:2048 --pin banzai --token-label bank-vaults --label bank-vaults
```

Check that in you got a keypair object in slot 0:

```bash
pkcs11-tool --list-objects
```
```
Using slot 0 with a present token (0x0)
Public Key Object; RSA 2048 bits
  label:      bank-vaults

  Usage:      encrypt, verify, wrap
  Access:     none
```

```bash
pkcs15-tool --list-keys
```
```

```

### Setup on Minikube for testing (optional)

On OSX where you run Docker in VMs you need to do some extra steps before developing to mount your HSM device to Kubernetes, on Linux you can skip the next section, where we [configure the HSM device](#unseal-hsm).

Here we use Minikube to test and validate the NitroKey setup, the following steps are needed to mount it into the `minikube` Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
# Specify VirtualBox as the VM backend
minikube config set vm-driver virtualbox

# You need to the Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack for USB 2.0 support, make sure it is installed
VBoxManage list extpacks

# Create a minikube cluster with the virtualbox driver and stop it (we need to modify the VM)
minikube start
minikube stop

# Enable USB 2.0 support for the minikube VM
VBoxManage modifyvm minikube --usbehci on

# Find the vendorid and productid for your Nitrokey HSM device
VBoxManage list usbhost

VENDORID=0x20a0
PRODUCTID=0x4230

# Create a filter for it
VBoxManage usbfilter add 1 --target minikube --name "Nitrokey HSM" --vendorid ${VENDORID} --productid ${PRODUCTID}

# Restart the minikube VM
minikube start

# Plug in the USB device now to your computer

# Check that minikube captured your NitorKey HSM
minikube ssh lsusb | grep ${VENDORID:2}:${PRODUCTID:2}
```

Now your `minikube` Kubernetes cluster has access to the HSM device through USB.

### Configuring the operator to use NitroKey HSM based unsealing {#unseal-hsm}

In the vault-operator the `unsealConfig` becomes a bit different for OpenSC HSM devices, there are certain things that the operator needs to be aware of to communicate with the device correctly:

```yaml
  # This example relies on an OpenSC HSM (NitroKey HSM) device initialized and plugged in to the Kubernetes Node.
  unsealConfig:
    hsm:
      # OpenSC daemon is needed in this case to communicate with the device
      daemon: true
      # The HSM SO module path (opensc is built into the bank-vaults image)
      modulePath: /usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so
      # For OpenSC slotId is the preferred way instead of tokenLabel
      # (OpenSC appends/prepends some extra stuff to labels)
      slotId: 0
      pin: banzai # This can be specified in the BANK_VAULTS_HSM_PIN environment variable as well, from a Secret
      keyLabel: bank-vaults
```

## Kubernetes node setup

Some HSM vendors offer network daemons to enhance the reach of their HSM equipment to different servers. Unfortunately, there is no networking standard defined for PKCS11 access and thus currently Bank-Vaults has to be scheduled to the same node where the HSM device is attached directly (if not using a Cloud HSM).

Since the HSM is a hardware device connected to a physical node, Bank-Vaults has to find its way to that node. To make this work, we create an HSM [extended resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/extended-resource-node/) on the Kubernetes nodes for which the HSM device is plugged in. Extended resources must be advertised in integer amounts. For example, a Node can advertise four HSM devices, but not 4.5.

1. You need to patch the node to specify that it has an HSM device as a resource. 
    Because of the integer constraint and because all Bank-Vaults related Pods has to land on a Node where an HSM resource is available we need to advertise two units for 1 device, one will be allocated by each Vault Pod and one by the Configurer. If you would like to run Vault in HA mode - multiple Vault instances in different nodes - you will need multiple HSM devices plugged into those nodes, having the same key and slot setup.

    ```bash
    kubectl proxy &

    NODE=minikube

    curl --header "Content-Type: application/json-patch+json" \
        --request PATCH \
        --data '[{"op": "add", "path": "/status/capacity/nitrokey.com~1hsm", "value": "2"}]' \
        http://localhost:8001/api/v1/nodes/${NODE}/status
    ```

    From now on, you can request the `nitrokey.com/hsm` resource [in the PodSpec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/extended-resource/)
1. Include the `nitrokey.com/hsm` resource in your PodSpec:

    ```yaml
      # If using the NitroKey HSM example, that resource has to be part of the resource scheduling request.
      resources:
        hsmDaemon:
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 64Mi
            nitrokey.com/hsm: 1
          limits:
            cpu: 200m
            memory: 128Mi
            nitrokey.com/hsm: 1
    ```

1. Apply the modified setup from scratch:

    ```bash
    kubectl delete vault vault
    kubectl delete pvc vault-file-vault-0
    kubectl delete secret vault-unseal-keys
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/banzaicloud/bank-vaults/master/operator/deploy/cr-hsm-nitrokey.yaml
    ```

1. Check the logs that unsealing uses the NitroKey HSM device. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl logs -f vault-0 bank-vaults
    ```

    The output should be something like:

    ```bash

    ```

1. Find the unseal keys and the root token on the HSM:

    ```bash
    pkcs11-tool --list-objects
    ```

    Expected output:

      flags:           modifiable
    ```

1. If you don't need the encryption keys or the unseal keys on the HSM anymore, you can delete them with the following commands:

    ```bash
    PIN=banzai

    # Delete the unseal keys and the root token
    for label in "vault-test" "vault-root" "vault-unseal-0" "vault-unseal-1" "vault-unseal-2" "vault-unseal-3" "vault-unseal-4"
    do
      pkcs11-tool --delete-object --type data --label ${label} --pin ${PIN}
    done

    # Delete the encryption key
    pkcs11-tool --delete-object --type privkey --label bank-vaults --pin ${PIN}
    ```

## Additional HSM implementations

AWS CloudHSM supports the PKCS11 API as well, so it should probably work, though it needs a custom Docker image. If you need help with that, [contact us for the details](/contact/).
