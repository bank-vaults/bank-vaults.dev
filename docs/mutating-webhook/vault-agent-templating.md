With Bank-Vaults you can use [Vault Agent](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/agent/) to handle secrets that expire, and supply them to applications that read their configurations from a file.

## When to use vault-agent

- You have an application or tool that requires to read its configuration from a file.
- You wish to have secrets that have a TTL and expire.
- You have no issues with running your application with a sidecar.

> Note: If you need to revoke tokens, or use additional secret backends, see {{% xref "/docs/bank-vaults/mutating-webhook/consul-template.md" %}}.

## Workflow

- Your pod starts up, the webhook will inject one container into the pods lifecycle.
- The sidecar container is running Vault, using the [vault agent](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/agent/) that accesses Vault using the configuration specified inside a configmap and writes a configuration file based on a pre configured template (written inside the same configmap) onto a temporary file system which your application can use.

## Prerequisites

This document assumes the following.

- You have a working Kubernetes cluster which has:

    - a working Vault installation
    - a working installation of the [mutating webhook](/docs/bank-vaults/mutating-webhook/).

- You have a working knowledge of Kubernetes.
- You can apply Deployments or PodSpec's to the cluster.
- You can change the configuration of the [mutating webhook](/docs/bank-vaults/mutating-webhook/configuration/).

## Use Vault TTLs

If you wish to use Vault TTLs, you need a way to HUP your application on configuration file change. You can [configure the Vault Agent to execute a command](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/agent/template/index.html) when it writes a new configuration file using the `command` attribute. The following is a basic example which uses the Kubernetes authentication method.

{{< include-code "vault-agent-templating-example.yaml" "yaml" >}}

## Configuration

To configure the webhook, you can either:

- set some sane defaults in the [environment of the mutating webhook](#defaults), or
- configure it via annotations in your [PodSpec](#podspec).

### Enable vault agent in the webhook

For the webhook to detect that it will need to mutate or change a PodSpec, add the `vault.security.banzaicloud.io/vault-agent-configmap` annotation to the Deployment or PodSpec you want to mutate, otherwise it will be ignored for configuration with Vault Agent.

### Defaults via environment variables {#defaults}

|Variable      |default     |Explanation|
|--------------|------------|------------|
|VAULT_IMAGE|vault:latest| the vault image to use for the sidecar container|
|VAULT_IMAGE_PULL_POLICY|IfNotPresent| The pull policy for the vault agent container|
|VAULT_ADDR    |https://127.0.0.1:8200|Kubernetes service Vault endpoint URL|
|VAULT_TLS_SECRET|""|supply a secret with the vault TLS CA so TLS can be verified|
|VAULT_AGENT_SHARE_PROCESS_NAMESPACE|Kubernetes version <1.12 default off, 1.12 or higher default on|ShareProcessNamespace override|as above|

### PodSpec annotations {#podspec}

|Annotation    |default     |Explanation|
|--------------|------------|------------|
vault.security.banzaicloud.io/vault-addr|Same as VAULT_ADDR above||
vault.security.banzaicloud.io/vault-tls-secret|Same as VAULT_TLS_SECRET above||
vault.security.banzaicloud.io/vault-agent-configmap|""|A configmap name which holds the vault agent configuration|
vault.security.banzaicloud.io/vault-agent-once|false|do not run vault-agent in daemon mode, useful for kubernetes jobs|
vault.security.banzaicloud.io/vault-agent-share-process-namespace|Same as VAULT_AGENT_SHARE_PROCESS_NAMESPACE above|
vault.security.banzaicloud.io/vault-agent-cpu|"100m"|Specify the vault-agent container CPU resource limit|
vault.security.banzaicloud.io/vault-agent-memory|"128Mi"|Specify the vault-agent container memory resource limit|
vault.security.banzaicloud.io/vault-configfile-path|"/vault/secrets"|Mount path of Vault Agent rendered files|
