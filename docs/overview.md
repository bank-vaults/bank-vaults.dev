Bank-Vaults provides the following tools for Hashicorp Vault to make its use easier and more automated:

- A [Kubernetes operator for provisioning secrets](/docs/bank-vaults/operator/).
- A [mutating webhook for injecting secrets](/docs/bank-vaults/mutating-webhook/).
- A [CLI tool](/docs/bank-vaults/cli-tool/) to automatically initialize, unseal, and configure Vault with authentication methods and secret engines.
- A [Go client wrapper](/docs/bank-vaults/go-library/) for the official Vault client with automatic token renewal, built-in Kubernetes support, and a dynamic database credential provider.
