Bank-Vaults tries to automate as much as possible for handling TLS certificates.

- The `vault-operator` automates the creation and renewal of TLS certificates for Vault.
- The `vault` Helm Chart automates only the creation of TLS certificates for Vault via [Sprig](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/crypto.html).

Both the operator and the chart generate a Kubernetes Secret holding the TLS certificates, this is named `${VAULT_CR_NAME}-tls`. For most examples in the [Bank-Vaults project repository](https://github.com/banzaicloud/bank-vaults/), the name of the secret is `vault-tls`.

The Secret data keys are:

- `ca.crt`
- `server.crt`
- `server.key`

> Note: The operator doesn't overwrite this Secret if it already exists, so you can provide this certificate in any other way, for example using [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) or by simply placing it there manually.

## Operator custom TLS settings

The following attributes influence the TLS settings of the operator. The `ca.crt` key is mandatory in [existingTlsSecretName](#existingtlssecretname), otherwise the Bank-Vaults components can't verify the Vault server certificate.

### CANamespaces

The list of namespaces where the generated CA certificate for Vault should be distributed. Use ["*"] for all namespaces.

Default value: *[]*

### ExistingTLSSecretName

The name of the secret that contains a TLS server certificate, key, and the corresponding CA certificate. The secret must be in the **kubernetes.io/tls type secret keys + ca.crt key** format. If the attribute is set, the operator uses the certificate already set in the secret, otherwise it generates a new one.

The `ca.crt` key is mandatory, otherwise the Bank-Vaults components can't verify the Vault server certificate.

Default value: *""*

### TLSAdditionalHosts

A list hostnames or IP addresses to add to the SAN on the automatically generated TLS certificate.

Default value: *[]*

### TLSExpiryThreshold

The expiration threshold of the Vault TLS certificate in Go Duration format.

Default value: *168h*

## Using the generated custom TLS certificate with vault-operator

To use an existing secret which contains the TLS certificate, define [existingTlsSecretName](#existingtlssecretname) in the Vault custom resource.

## Generate custom certificates with CFSSL

If you don't want to use the certificates generated by Helm or the Bank-Vaults operator, the easiest way to create a custom certificate for Bank-Vaults is using [CFSSL](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl).

The [https://github.com/banzaicloud/bank-vaults-docs/tree/master/docs/tls directory](https://github.com/banzaicloud/bank-vaults-docs/tree/master/docs/tls) holds a set of custom CFSSL configurations which are prepared for the Helm release name `vault` in the `default` namespace. Of course, you can put any other certificates into the Secret below, this is just an example.

1. Install [CFSSL](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl).
1. Create a CA:

    ```bash
    cfssl genkey -initca csr.json | cfssljson -bare ca
    ```

1. Create a server certificate:

    ```bash
    cfssl gencert -ca=ca.pem -ca-key=ca-key.pem -config=config.json -profile=server server.json | cfssljson -bare server
    ```

1. Put these certificates (and the server key) into a Kubernetes Secret:

    ```bash
    kubectl create secret generic vault-tls --from-file=ca.crt=ca.pem --from-file=server.crt=server.pem --from-file=server.key=server-key.pem
    ```

1. Install the Vault instance:

    - With the chart which uses this certificate:

    ```bash
    helm upgrade --install vault ../charts/vault --set tls.secretName=vault-tls
    ```

    - With the operator, create a Vault custom resource, and apply it:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f vault-cr.yaml
    ```

## Generate custom certificates with cert-manager

You can use the following [cert-manager custom resource](https://cert-manager.io) to generate a certificate for Bank-Vaults.

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: test-selfsigned
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-cert
spec:
  commonName: vault
  usages:
    - server auth
  dnsNames:
    - vault
    - vault.default
    - vault.default.svc
    - vault.default.svc.cluster.local
  ipAddresses:
    - 127.0.0.1
  secretName: selfsigned-cert-tls
  issuerRef:
    name: test-selfsigned
EOF
```
